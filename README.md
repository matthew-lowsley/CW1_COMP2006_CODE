# Profile Microservice

This is an implementation for my protocol in CW1 in COMP2006, 2024.
The implementation is written in python using the opensource cryptography package.

This code is to demonstrate my application of knowledge for cryptography primatives notably hash functions, digital signatures and asymmetric encryption.
